GSCommons-Java
==============

Right now, this project contains a single package, com.gbosystems.utility, with the following classes:

GSData
GSNumericalSeries
GSParser
GSReadInputStream
GSSystem

This project was created using NetBeans IDE 7.2.1, although importing it into other IDEs should be trivial.
